# NJC0 2020 website
1st place in New Jersey Chemistry Olympics: Web Design. 
By: Max Myron, Michael Peluso, Jimmy Scholz

## Brief

pops.mmyron.com was created as a formal entry into the 2020 New Jersey Chemistry Olympics in the Web Design category. The whole of the website was written in HTML, CSS, and JS. For this year, we used several libraries to add functionality to our site.

We used ChemDoodleWeb, a relatively niche WebGL component that allows us to display .mol files rendered in 3D for an interactive and fun look at the molecules.

We also used several bleeding-edge CSS properties like clip-path for a stunning design. **This webpage is best viewed on Chrome or Firefox.**

During the development of the site, I created a few SVG assets using my own design knowledge to help break up the content and add fluidity that HTML and CSS just couldn't. All of the graphics were created in Inkscape and exported to 4K PNG.
