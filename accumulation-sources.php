                    <h1 class="manrope font-weight-bolder text-center text-gradient-mint-blue">Introduction</h1>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em" id="introduction-text">Being extremely resistant to natural and environmental decomposition, persistent organic pollutants build up immensely as time progresses. Their resistance to breakdown is essentially based on their physical and chemical features including molecular size, hydrogen bonding, ion exchange, and lipophilic affinity. In addition, POPs can easily resist degradation due to their chemical stability, usually involving a benzene ring. Such factors affect the preferential partition concept - an argument that states that a substance has a “choice” to migrate between different mixtures due to its affinity for each. In other words, molecules are absorbed by substances that express the most attraction. Therefore, organic pollutants are absorbed by substances that allow them to resist breakdown and degradation. A lack of natural circulation and biodegradation causes the amount of POPs in the environment to stockpile. They have been found in remote areas around the globe including the Arctic and deserted islands. As organic contaminants amass within the environment, nearby animals fall victim to their influence. Lipophilic properties give the pollutants the ability to store in the fatty tissues of organisms and can rise up the food chain to top predators and humans. While POPs generally accumulate in soil, aquatic, and atmospheric settings, they can be found anywhere on Earth.</p>

                    <h1 class="manrope font-weight-bolder text-center text-gradient-mint-blue textsize-4em">Sources</h1>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">Persistent organic pollutants have been emitted into the environment both purposefully and accidentally. Some of the dirty dozen, like Aldrin, Dieldrin, and DDT, are intentional pesticides that were used for crops. Others, however, like Hexachlorobenzene, PCDDs, and PCDFs, are unintentional byproducts of different chemical and combustion processes.</p>

                    <h3 class="manrope font-weight-bolder">Intentional sources</h3>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">There are several methods of intentional creation and release of persistent organic pollutants. The most often use for organic pollutants is as a crop pesticide. Chemicals like DDT, for example, were widely used in the 1970s as a pesticide, and it is still used today as a malaria controller in poorer, developing countries because it is still extremely efficient as a pesticide. Likewise, Hexachlorobenzene is a fungicide, meaning that it attacks nearby mycelium and fungi colonies in an attempt to keep crops healthy.</p>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">Some pollutants, like Mirex, have different purposes. Mirex serves both as a pesticide against termites and rats, and as a fire retardant in plastics and rubbers. PCBs, on the other hand, are used as industrial chemicals in heat exchange fluids and coolants because of their low flammability. PCB is also used as an additive to paint, sealants, and plastics.</p>

                    <h3 class="manrope font-weight-bolder">Unintentional sources</h3>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">Some organic pollutants, on the other hand, serve little to no function to us, and instead accumulate as waste by-products from other processes (sometimes even during the production of other persistent organic pollutants!) Dioxins and furans share similar emissions patterns and are both unintentional byproducts. Dioxins, on one hand, are emitted from the combustion of hospital, municipal, and hazardous wastes, as well as from automobile emissions. Furans share many of the same emissions patterns as dioxins, but are also an unintentional byproduct during the production of PCBs.</p>

                <!-- REPLACEMENT -->
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">Being extremely resistant to natural and environmental decomposition, persistent organic pollutants build up immensely as time progresses. Their resistance to breakdown is essentially based on their physical and chemical features including molecular size, hydrogen bonding, ion exchange, and lipophilic affinity. In addition, POPs can easily resist degradation due to their chemical stability, usually involving a benzene ring(superscript where necessary). Such factors affect the preferential partition concept - an argument that states that a substance has a “choice” to migrate between different mixtures due to its affinity for each. In other words, molecules are absorbed by substances that express the most attraction. Therefore, organic pollutants are absorbed by substances that allow them to resist breakdown and degradation. A lack of natural circulation and biodegradation causes the amount of POPs in the environment to stockpile. They have been found in remote areas around the globe including the Arctic and deserted islands. As organic contaminants amass within the environment, nearby animals fall victim to their influence. Lipophilic properties give the pollutants the ability to store in the fatty tissues of organisms and can rise up the food chain to top predators andw humans. While POPs generally accumulate in <b>soil</b>, <b>aquatic</b>, and <b>atmospheric</b> settings, they can be found anywhere on Earth.</p>

                    <h1 class="manrope font-weight-bolder text-center text-gradient-mint-blue">Soil</h1>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">The resistance of breakdown in soil fundamentally rests over the soil matrix itself. POPs can avoid biodegradation by microorganisms and bacteria by escaping into organic matter. Physical and chemical pulls between organic pollutant and soil contents substantially influence a POP’s absorption and movement within the matrix. Due to the extreme worldwide diversity of soil contents, preferential partition may cause pollutants to be absorbed into soil organic matter, plants, bacteria, or groundwater. For example, it is common for POPs to show preferential partitioning towards the soil organic matter in the presence of rich, nutritious soil. They may also very well infiltrate plant roots and gather in plant leaves themselves. Although pollutant movement in soil is not yet completely understood, more factors like K<sub>oc</sub> and lipophilicity can help explain why POPs are more attracted to some areas in soil rather than others.</p>

                    <h3 class="manrope font-weight-bolder">K<sub>oc</sub> factor</h3>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">The soil adsorption coefficient, also known as the K<sub>oc</sub> factor, is a method for determining the resistance of a particular chemical to movement in soil. Persistent organic pollutants all notable have very high K<sub>oc</sub> factors, meaning that they all heavily resist movement in soil, even when drenched in water. The K<sub>oc</sub> factor depends substantially on the hydrophobicity of the substance in question, where a higher hydrophobicity equates to stronger soil adsorption. The K<sub>oc</sub> factor also depends on the amount of organic matter in the soil. The organic matter allows the chemicals to form ion bonds with the matter, which also gives water less of a force in moving it around.</p>


                    <h1 class="manrope font-weight-bolder text-center text-gradient-mint-blue">Water</h1>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">In aquatic settings, persistent organic pollutants tend to accumulate in ambient animals and organisms. This is due to the dominance of polar water molecules, molecular size differences, and K<sub>ow</sub> factors all working together to increase the attraction between organic pollutants and the biosphere. POPs simply accumulate in organisms due to the complete bombardment of unattractive water molecules in any body of water. Their lipophilic properties cause them to attract towards the fatty tissue of aquatic animals.</p>

                    <h3 class="manrope font-weight-bolder">K<sub>ow</sub> factor</h3>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">Like the K<sub>ow</sub> factor, the K<sub>ow</sub> factor is simply a coefficient for determining the solubility of a chemical in water. The lower a K<sub>ow</sub> factor is, the more soluble in water a chemical is. Many of the dirty dozen, as well as the rest of the persistent organic pollutants, have extremely high K<sub>ow</sub> factors, sometimes stretching well into the millions.</p>

                    <h1 class="manrope font-weight-bolder text-center text-gradient-mint-blue">Air</h1>
                    <p class="manrope font-weight-thin textsize-1em">Organic pollutants can very easily be taken up by any horizontal crosswinds. The presence of wind more or less indirectly aids in the accumulation of POPs by dispersing them away from their immediate area of influence. Parallel drafts redistribute emissions from the spraying of pesticides and the combustion of oil. A pollutant’s molecular vapor pressure, which is influenced by temperature, has significant impact on its physical state. An increase of ten degrees celsius, for example, multiplies an organic contaminant’s volatility by four times. Especially because POPs are semi-volatile, their aerobic movement is highly anticipated.</p>
